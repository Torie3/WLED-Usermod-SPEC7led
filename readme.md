# Welcome to this wled Usermod ‚ú®

This usermod enables connection of an ESP32 (ESP32 Devboard or ESP32-C3) to a flight controller, allowing users to select specific presets with a switch on their remote. Originally developed for Spec7 quads, this mod can be applied to any project where a preset needs to be activated based on a PWM signal received on a designated pin.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
**WLED** is a project that allows easy control of addressable RGB lights. Our focus is on enabling users to switch between different presets set up in the WLED app using a physical switch on the controller. This is achieved by leveraging a built-in feature in **Betaflight or Inav** that generates a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal on a specific pin‚Äîtypically used for controlling servos. While we could have read data directly from the receiver, we opted for the PWM approach for several reasons outlined below.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Using PWM
***Advantages:***
- **Compatible with Any Remote Protocol Supported by Betaflight:** Allows flexibility across various remote protocols.
- **Minimal Data Processing from Receiver:** Only the PWM signal is processed, improving the program‚Äôs speed and efficiency.
- **Standalone Use with PWM Receivers:** Can operate as a standalone unit with just the controller and LEDs, without a flight controller (FC).
- **Protocol Agnostic:** No need to adapt to specific protocols, making the setup easily adaptable.
- **Avoids UART Conflicts:** WLED may interfere with LED-receiver communication, particularly when multiple UARTs are used (one for the receiver and one for LEDs), as adding a software serial port can consume significant processing power.

***Disadvantages:***
- **Requires a Flight Controller or PWM Receiver:** Cannot function as a standalone unit with just the receiver, ESP, and LEDs.
- **Single-Channel Limitation:** Multiple channels for selecting presets would require additional wiring and pins on the FC.
- **Consumes a Pin on the Flight Controller:** Typically, the LED pin is used, but additional motor pins may also be viable.
### Advantages and Disadvantages of Direct Receiver Connection
***Advantages:***
- **Access to Full Receiver Data:** Allows use of multiple channels.
- **Standalone Operation:** Can function with just the receiver, ESP, and LEDs.
- **No Flight Controller Pin Usage:** Frees up all pins on the flight controller.

***Disadvantages:***
- **Requires Soldering on Receiver Pads:** Soldering two wires onto a single receiver pad can be cumbersome.
- **Limited to One Remote Protocol:** Only one remote protocol can be used in this configuration.
- **Increased Processing Power Demand:** Requires significant processing resources, potentially impacting performance.
### Conclusion
Considering these factors, we chose the PWM option, which offers a balanced approach in terms of flexibility, performance, and ease of setup. For instructions on setting up the system, refer to the Quick Start Guide.
