# Welcome to this wled Usermod ‚ú®

This usermod enables connection of an ESP32 (ESP32 Devboard or ESP32-C3) to a flight controller, allowing users to select specific presets with a switch on their remote. Originally developed for Spec7 quads, this mod can be applied to any project where a preset needs to be activated based on a PWM signal received on a designated pin.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
**WLED** is a project that allows easy control of addressable RGB lights. Our focus is on enabling users to switch between different presets set up in the WLED app using a physical switch on the controller. This is achieved by leveraging a built-in feature in **Betaflight or Inav** that generates a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal on a specific pin‚Äîtypically used for controlling servos. While we could have read data directly from the receiver, we opted for the PWM approach for several reasons outlined below.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Using PWM
***Advantages:***
- **Compatible with Any Remote Protocol Supported by Betaflight:** Allows flexibility across various remote protocols.
- **Minimal Data Processing from Receiver:** Only the PWM signal is processed, improving the program‚Äôs speed and efficiency.
- **Standalone Use with PWM Receivers:** Can operate as a standalone unit with just the controller and LEDs, without a flight controller (FC).
- **Protocol Agnostic:** No need to adapt to specific protocols, making the setup easily adaptable.
- **Avoids UART Conflicts:** WLED may interfere with LED-receiver communication, particularly when multiple UARTs are used (one for the receiver and one for LEDs), as adding a software serial port can consume significant processing power.

***Disadvantages:***
- **Requires a Flight Controller or PWM Receiver:** Cannot function as a standalone unit with just the receiver, ESP, and LEDs.
- **Single-Channel Limitation:** Multiple channels for selecting presets would require additional wiring and pins on the FC.
- **Consumes a Pin on the Flight Controller:** Typically, the LED pin is used, but additional motor pins may also be viable.
### Advantages and Disadvantages of Direct Receiver Connection
***Advantages:***
- **Access to Full Receiver Data:** Allows use of multiple channels.
- **Standalone Operation:** Can function with just the receiver, ESP, and LEDs.
- **No Flight Controller Pin Usage:** Frees up all pins on the flight controller.

***Disadvantages:***
- **Requires Soldering on Receiver Pads:** Soldering two wires onto a single receiver pad can be cumbersome.
- **Limited to One Remote Protocol:** Only one remote protocol can be used in this configuration.
- **Increased Processing Power Demand:** Requires significant processing resources, potentially impacting performance.
### Conclusion
Considering these factors, we chose the PWM option, which offers a balanced approach in terms of flexibility, performance, and ease of setup. For instructions on setting up the system, refer to the Quick Start Guide.


## üí° Quick Start Guide
**Betaflight Setup**
1) **Enable Servo on Flight Controller**

Ensure you flash your flight controller with servo enabled.

2) **Standard Flight Controller Setup**

Set up your flight controller as you normally would.

3) **Check Resource Pins in CLI**

Open the CLI and paste the following command to display all resources and their pin assignments:

`resource`

Find resource LED_STRIP 1 in the output and note the pin number next to it (e.g., A08).

4) **Reassign LED Strip Pin to Servo**

Enter the following commands in the CLI to remove the LED strip assignment from this pin and assign it to Servo 1:

```
resource LED_STRIP none
resource SERVO 1 "your noted pin number from step 4"
save
```

5) **Configure Servo Settings**

Go to the Servo tab and adjust the settings marked in the red box in the image below. Only the channel associated with the button to switch presets needs to be adjusted here. In the Receiver tab, you can check which button corresponds to which action. (We recommend using a 6-button switch on your controller; however, other setups may work, although results may vary.)

***Note: This configuration won‚Äôt work when connected to your computer unless ‚Äúlive mode‚Äù is enabled.***

### Hardware Setup
1) **Connect Ground**

Connect the ground on your flight controller to the ground on the ESP. This is mandatory, as it sets a shared reference.

2) **Connect Data Pin**

Connect the LED pin on your flight controller to gpio 2 on the ESP (not pin 2, it must be gpio 2). This wire carries the data.

3) **Power the ESP and LEDs**

Power the ESP as needed, and connect the LEDs like a standard WLED setup.

***Note: The following diagram provides an example for wiring. Do not copy it exactly; please research how to power your ESP safely. We are not liable for any physical or material damage.***

### ESP Setup
1) **Download Firmware**

In build_output/releases, select your board and download the .bin file (avoid .bin.gz files).

2) **Set Up Programming Tool**

Visit [Espressif‚Äôs esptool-js](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/) and set the program baud rate to 460800.

3) **Connect ESP to Computer**

Plug your ESP into your computer via USB.

4) **Establish Connection**

Click ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù and select the correct COM port.

5) **Upload Firmware**

Click ‚ÄúChoose File‚Äù and select the .bin file downloaded in Step 1, then click ‚ÄúProgram‚Äù and wait until the process completes.

### Final Steps
Now, set up WLED as you normally would. Ensure you have six presets; without them, you may encounter errors when switching. This setup is designed to work with 6-button switches (e.g., Radiomaster Boxer and TX16s), but a future revision will support 2- and 3-position switches.

Enjoy your new LED setup on your spec 7 quad!
